        <h2>A little about me:</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Jessica Amend, I am a sophomore at Colorado State University Pueblo studying Strategic Communications. I grew up in a small tow in Erie Colorado, about 20 minutes East of Boulder. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I came to Pueblo to play volleyball and have been playing since I was 10 years old. Aside from school and volleyball I enjoy spending time outdoors, hiking, going to the lake, and spending time with my family. I have a small family consisting of me, my parents Mike and Roxane, and my dog Savy. 
        </p> 
        <p> 
            In the future I hope to work in Public Relations managing social media image and company outreach. Outside of work, I am looking forward to traveling to different countries and experiencing other cultures.
        </p>
